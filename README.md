A lot of people want to help Ukraine in this war but they don't have enough knowledge to use some scripts but all of us have phones. Atack list will be updated from the official telegram channel [IT ARMY of Ukraine](https://t.me/itarmyofukraine2022).

Just download the APK and launch it! -> [LATEST RELEASE](https://github.com/ohnu11/OpDrop/releases/tag/Release)

**Note:** this app is not about clean code / nice architecture etc. I don't need your comment about it. If you want to improve something - you are welcome! Just push your changes! If you have ideas, feel free to open issues/discussions here.

Here is a config example:
```
{
    "version": 1,
    "max_threads": 200,
    "urls": [
        {"url": "udp://123.45.67.89:53", "method":"UDP" },
        {"url": "tcp://123.45.67.89:53", "method":"TCP" },
        {"url": "https://wow-super-website.com", "method":"GET" },
        {"url": "https://wow-super-website.com?search=hehe", "method":"GET" },
        {"url": "https://wow-super-website.com/login.php", "method":"POST", "data": "username=aaa&password=aaa1234" }
    ],

- [ ] Improve UI
